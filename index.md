## About Me

I am a PhD student from Georgia Tech advised by [Dr. Fumin Zhang](https://fumin.ece.gatech.edu/) and [Dr. Ronald C. Arkin](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/aimosaic/faculty/arkin/). I design and develop algorithms and tools for **heterogeneous multi-robot teams** to coordinate effectively in challenging environments. I also study human-robot interaction, focusing on robotic deceptions.

## Research Interests

- **Robotics:** multi-robot systems, task allocation, human-robot interaction
- **Machine Learning:** multi-agent reinforcement learning, graph neural network

## News
- **[Oct. 2023]** I am going to Detroit, MI to present my paper on IROS 2023!
